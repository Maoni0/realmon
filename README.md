# GCRealTimeMon
This is a monitoring tool that tells you when GCs happen in a .NET process and characteristics about these GCs.

Right now it's super simple - given a PID or process name it will show you a few things about GCs as they happen in that process.

## Command Line Arguments

| Command Line Argument | Name | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| n | Name of the Process | Grabs the first process with the name matching that with the one specified with this argument |
| p | Process Id | Process Id to monitor GC for |
| c | Path of a YAML configuration File to use | This can be used to override default configuration either through another file or manual column selection that will also update the default when no file is provided. |
| g | Path of a YAML configuration file to generate | Select the columns to display and the corresponding configuration will be saved to the given YAML file and used for the current monitoring session.|

Note: Either the name of the process or the process id must be specified, else an ``ArgumentException`` is thrown.

## Runtime Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|-----|
| `s` | Prints detailed stats of the last collection and the state of each generation |

## Example Usage

```
GCRealTimeMon -p 14028
```

or

```
GCRealTimeMon -n devenv
```

Example output:

```
------- press s for current stats or any other key to exit -------

## Configuration

The configuration file is a YAML based file currently with the following sections:
- __columns__: The columns to display. 
- __available_columns__: All columns that are available to display.
- __stats_mode__: Configurations related to the heap stats. 
  - ``timer``: Specifying this with a period magnitude and type that dictates the candence of the timer that prints the heap stats.
    - the period type can either be in minutes 'm' or seconds 's'.
    - the period magnitude has to be as an int.
    - Examples: 
      - ``"timer" : "5m"  # 5 minutes``
      - ``"timer" : "20s" # 20 seconds``
  - A full example with the Heap printing every 30 seconds can be found [here](tests/GCRealTimeMon.UnitTests/ConfigurationReader/TestConfigurations/DefaultWithStatsMode.yaml)
- __display_conditions__: Conditions via which info about each GC is displayed.
  - ``min gc duration (msec)``: Specifying this value will filter GCs with pause durations less than the said value. 
  - Examples:
    - ``min gc duration (msec) : 200``
    - ``min gc duration (msec) : 10.0``
    - ``min gc duration (msec) : 200.254``

Currently, the available columns are:

| Column Name            | Full Name / Description                                                                                                                                                         | Trace Event Property                                                                      |

## Adding New Columns

The process to add a new column from the ``TraceGC`` event is the following:

1. Include the column name in the ``available_columns`` in the Default.yaml config.
2. Define a ``ColumnInfo`` object in the ``ColumnInfoMap`` with the following properties:
   1. The name
   2. Alignment
   3. A ``Func<TraceGC, object>`` that looks up an object in via a ``TraceGC`` event.
   4. Format (optional)
3. Optionally add corresponding unit tests.
4. Update the documentation here with the new column.

## Unit Tests

The unit tests are in the ``test`` directory and can be run by:

```
dotnet test
```

## Building

**Build with VS**

Open ``GCRealTimeMon.sln`` and build it with Visual Studio.

**Build with command line**

```bash
cd src/GCRealTimeMon
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 # build on Windows
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 # build on Linux
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64 # build on macOS
```

Additionaly, you can pass `/p:AotCompilation=true` to build GCRealTimeMon with [NativeAOT](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT).
This requires native C++ toolchain (MSVC or clang) to be installed on the machine.

```bash
cd src/GCRealTimeMon
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 /p:AotCompilation=true # build on Windows
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 /p:AotCompilation=true # build on Linux
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64 /p:AotCompilation=true # build on macOS
```

Build artifacts can be found in `bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/[rid]/publish`.

**Build dotnet-gcmon tool with command line**

```bash
cd src/dotnet-gcmon
dotnet build -c Release
```

## How to generate the global .NET CLI tool dotnet-gcmon

Such a tool is simply a console application stored in a nuget package with some specific properties.
The dotnet-gcmon.csproj file contains the corresponding settings and link to the implementation of the GCRealTimeMon console application.

When building this dotnet-gcmon C# project, a nuget package (dotnet-gcmon.(version x.y.z).nupkg) is generated under the nupkg folder.
Ensure that the configuration is "Release" to publish a new version.

It is also possible to manually generate the package in Release, by using the following command in the .csproj folder:
```bash
dotnet pack -c Release
```

If you make changes to the global tool you should test it locally by first uninstalling an existing version 

````bash
dotnet tool uninstall -g dotnet-gcmon
````

and then installing the local .nupkg with this command line:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-gcmon --version 0.5.0 --add-source C:\realmon\src\dotnet-gcmon\nupkg\
```

(replace `0.5.0` with the version you specified in the .csproj and  `C:\realmon` with the name of your dir for the tool)

To publish a new version, upload the new dotnet-gcmon.(version x.y.z).nupkg file to https://www.nuget.org/packages/manage/upload.

After a while, it should appear under https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotnet-gcmon.

At that point, use the following command to install it on a machine:

```bash
   dotnet tool install -g dotnet-gcmon
```

NOTE: to prepare a new version, update the following property
    <PackageVersion>x.y.z</PackageVersion>
in the .csproj file before building/generating the nuget package.

NOTE: when new files are added to GCRealTimeMon project, don't forget to add them as links in the dotnet-gcmon.csproj file.

Read https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools-how-to-create for more details about creating a global .NET CLI tool.


## Contribution

Contributions are very welcome! Tasks I'm currently thinking about -

+ More info about GCs (the TraceGC class in TraceEvent provides a ton of info about each GC).
+ Take more command line args that allow uses to specify things like only show GCs that are blocking or show the allocated bytes in gen0/LOH inbetween GCs.

If you are interested in working on any of these, your contributions are very much appreciated. Or if you have suggestions on other features, feel free to open an issue or a PR.
