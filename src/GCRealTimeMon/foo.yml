# Selected Columns to Display
columns:
- type # The Type of GC.
- gen # The Generation
- pause (ms) # The time managed threads were paused during this GC, in milliseconds
- reason # Reason for GC.
- suspension time (ms) # The time in milliseconds that it took to suspend all threads to start this GC 
- pause time (%) # The amount of time that execution in managed code is blocked because the GC needs exclusive use to the heap. For background GCs this is small.
- gen0 alloc (mb) # Amount allocated in Gen0 since the last GC occurred in MB.
- gen0 size (mb) # Size of gen0 at the end of this GC in MB.
- gen1 size (mb) # Size of gen1 at the end of this GC in MB.
- gen2 size (mb) # Size of gen2 at the end of this GC in MB.
- LOH size (mb) # Size of LOH at the end of this GC in MB.
